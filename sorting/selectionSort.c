/*Time Complexity: O(n2) as there are two nested loops.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)
The good thing about selection sort is it never makes more than O(n) swaps and can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.
Time Complexities:

Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then, the worst case occurs.
Best Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the array is already sorted
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).
